# Project Architecture & Conventions

- **Repo scope**: This repo is the frontend only. The Go backend lives in a separate repo (`suraj-drive-api`) and is reached over HTTP.
- **Next.js 16 App Router**: Uses the root `app/` directory (there is no `src/` folder).
- **Custom Port**: The development and start servers run on port **4000** (`npm run dev`), not the default 3000.
- **Route Groups**: The `app/` structure uses route groups heavily, such as `app/(archive)/`.
- **Path Aliases**: The `@/*` path alias resolves to the project root `./*` (e.g., `@/app/...`, `@/lib/...`), not a `src/` directory.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/postcss`. There is no `tailwind.config.js` — tokens are wired through `app/globals.css`.
- **API contract**: All HTTP calls go through `lib/api/` helpers, which read `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` / `API_URL` (default `http://localhost:4001`). Do not hardcode the backend URL elsewhere.
